# MusicQueue
A web app for people to queue their favourite music while at an event or a party. MusicQueue uses the Spotify Web API.

### Dependencies
In order to run this program you need to have a Spotify Premium account and register an app at [spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). When that is fixed you can insert the following lines in app.js (adding your own secret and id).  
```var client_id = 'CLIENT_ID';```  
```var client_secret = 'CLIENT_SECRET';```

### Getting started
Navigate to the root folder and run **npm install** to install dependencies and type **node app.js** to launch the server.
